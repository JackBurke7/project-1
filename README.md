# Pong Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using HTML and JavaScript. The game features a paddle that you can control to bounce the ball back and forth. The objective is to keep the ball in play and score points by bouncing it off the paddle. The game has a win condition when you score 10 points, and you can restart the game if you miss the ball.

## How to Play

Open the index.html file in your web browser.

Use the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard to control the paddle.

Bounce the ball off the paddle to score points.

The game ends when you miss the ball or score 10 points.

If you miss the ball, a confirmation dialog will ask if you want to restart the game. Click "OK" to restart.

If you score 10 points, an alert will appear congratulating you, and you can click "OK" to restart the game.

## Files

index.html: The main HTML file that contains the game canvas and links to the JavaScript and CSS files.

script.js: The JavaScript file that defines the game logic, including ball and paddle movement, collision detection, and game restart functionality.

style.css: The CSS file that provides basic styling for the game container.

## Technologies Used

- HTML

## Customization
You can customize the game by modifying the following parameters in the script.js file:

ballImage.src: Change the image of the ball by setting a different image URL.

paddle.width: Adjust the width of the paddle.

paddle.speed: Change the paddle's movement speed.

score === 10: Modify the score required to win the game.
